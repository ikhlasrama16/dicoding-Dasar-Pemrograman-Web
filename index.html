                    The capybara, scientifically known as "Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris," is a fascinating and unique mammal 
                    native to South America. It is one of the world's largest rodent species, often referred to as the 
                    "giant water rodent." Capybaras have sturdy, large bodies with short legs, and they are covered in coarse 
                    brown, gray, or light brown fur. Their small ears, large eyes, and high-set nose make them well-adapted to 
                    their semi-aquatic lifestyle. As herbivores, they primarily feed on grass, leaves, and aquatic plants, and 
                    their social nature is evident as they form groups, called "herds," displaying complex social hierarchies 
                    and bonding by resting close together or swimming in the water. Capybaras are known for their friendly and 
                    peaceful disposition towards both humans and other animals, making them a captivating species in South 
                    America's diverse wildlife.</p>

                    The anatomy of a capybara is intriguing and well-suited to its semi-aquatic lifestyle. These large 
                    rodents have sturdy, barrel-shaped bodies covered in coarse brown, gray, or light brown fur. Their 
                    short legs and partially webbed feet make them agile swimmers, allowing them to navigate in and out
                    of water with ease. Capybaras are known for their high-set eyes and small ears, which sit atop their
                    heads, enabling them to keep a watchful eye on their surroundings while partially submerged in water.
                    Their adapted nostrils are positioned at the top of their snouts, allowing them to breathe while most
                    of their bodies are submerged. These unique physical characteristics contribute to their success in
                    their natural habitat, where they graze on aquatic plants and grasses and interact with their 
                    fellow capybaras in social herds.</p>

                        <p>Capybaras belong to the rodent family (Rodentia) and are the world's largest rodents. They can 
                            grow to approximately 1.2 meters in length and weigh between 35 to 66 kilograms. Due to their 
                            substantial size, they are often referred to as "giant water rodents."

                        <p>Capybaras are highly social animals that live in large groups known as "herds" or "groups." 
                            These groups can range from a few individuals to dozens of capybaras living together. They 
                            exhibit a complex social structure with leaders in the group and a carefully maintained 
                            hierarchy.

                        <p>Capybaras are semi-aquatic animals and are excellent swimmers. They have small ears and large eyes,
                            which allow them to navigate while swimming. Capybaras can also dive and even rest in the water 
                            to evade predators. They are often found near rivers, and water is an integral part of their 
                            daily life, serving both as a source of food and a place for shelter.
